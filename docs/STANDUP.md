# Standup

Every Tuesday and Thursday, team members answer questions in order to brief the other members on their progress and problems (if any):

**Q1:** What have I done since my previous report?  
**Q2:** What am I currently doing and plan to do?  
**Q3:** Do I currently have any blockers?  

Answers to these questions are updated in this document at the end of every week.
